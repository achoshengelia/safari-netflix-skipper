# Welcome to Netflix Skipper!

After switching back to Safari, I realised I missed this extension. While I found it on the App Store, it costs €6. I can’t publish it myself because the Apple Developer Program requires a $99/year membership, which I’m unwilling to pay. However, I still want to make this feature accessible since for whatever reason Netflix isn't integrating it into their app.

## How to start

1. Clone the repo
2. Build the project
3. Run the built app from 
   _**~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Netflix_Skipper/Build/Products/Debug/Netflix\ Skipper**_
4. Go to **_Safari Settings > Developer_** and toggle **_Allow unsigned extensions_**
5. Turn on the **_Netflix Skipper_** from the **_Extensions_** tab
6. When opening Netflix you might get a popup saying **_The extension "Netflix Skipper" would like to access netflix.com._** Click **_Always Allow on This Website_**
7. After this, you should be able to use the extension
